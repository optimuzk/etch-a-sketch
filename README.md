# etch-a-sketch or Pizarra Magica!

This project is finished. I learned a lot about DOM and JS with the use of EventListeners for make the functionalities of the whiteboard.

It is suposse to be one of those whiteboards where you can't lift the pencil.

## To-do

I'd like to make the webpage more responsive, also implement more functionalities to make it more interesting.

- Add mediaqueries
